"""The grammatical terms a form is labelled with, what each one is, and Wiktionary's words for it.

A form in a pack carries the tags the dump gave its row in the entry's table, joined by spaces:
Spanish "anduvo" is "indicative preterite singular third-person". The card names those terms,
and a reader who points at one is learning it, so the explanation is Wiktionary's own: the
definition its glossary (Appendix:Glossary on en.wiktionary.org) gives the term, or where the
glossary has none, the grammar sense of the term's own English entry. Both are CC BY-SA, like
the rest of what the packs are built from, and nothing here is written by us: a term Wiktionary
does not explain is kept with no text rather than with one we made up.

  uv run --with orjson python tools/grammar_terms.py

It reads every dump in .cache/kaikki (the files tools/split_kaikki.py writes) and writes
data/grammar.json. Pages fetched from Wiktionary and GitHub, and the tag counts, are kept in
.cache/grammar, so a second run reads the network only for what it lacks; delete that
directory to fetch everything again.

Which tags count. A tag is counted once for every row of an entry's forms it is on, with the
rows the pack builder drops left out (core/packbuild/src/lib.rs: a table header, an auxiliary,
a conjugation class, a form with a pronoun attached). A tag on fewer than MIN_ROWS rows across
every language is a stray from the extractor rather than a term a reader will meet, and is left
out of the file.

What each tag is. wiktextract, which made the dump, files every tag it can emit under a
category of its own (valid_tags in src/wiktextract/tags.py), and those categories are what this
starts from: its "mood", "tense", "case" and so on are taken as they are, its "referent"
(definite, indefinite) is definiteness and its "non-finite" is nonfinite. Where its filing is
not what the tag means in the forms a reader sees, OVERRIDE says what it is instead and why,
each decided by reading rows the tag is on. A tag that names no grammatical value (a region, a
usage label, a note on the row) goes into "other" with a line saying what it is: the line
OTHER_REASON or OVERRIDE gives it, or else the one for its wiktextract category.

Which text. The glossary is one long list: a term on a line beginning with ";", with the ids it
can be linked by in {{anchor|...}}, and its definition on the lines beginning with ":" below it.
A value is looked for in the glossary under its most specific name first ("partitive case"
before "partitive", whose glossary entry is the partitive of a quantity), and a definition that
only says "See X" is followed to X. Where the glossary has no entry, the term's own English
entry is read, again the specific name first ("illative case"), and of the senses labelled
grammar or linguistics under a Noun or Adjective heading the first that names the value's
category is taken, or the first at all. A case is only ever explained by a text that calls it
a case, since many case names are ordinary words with another grammar sense. What is kept is
the first sentence, with the wiki markup taken out and the words and punctuation left as
Wiktionary has them. Each text records the page and the anchor or heading it came from.

The order. A grammar table lists the values of a category in an order of its own, and the card
lists them the same way: ORDER is that order, read from Wiktionary's conjugation and declension
tables (Spanish and French verbs, German, Latin, Russian, Polish, Czech and Finnish nouns,
German and Swedish adjectives). Cases come nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, as the
German, Latin and Slavic tables print them, then the Slavic cases, then the Finnish local cases
in the order the Finnish table gives them. A value the order does not name comes after the
ones it does, the commonest first.
