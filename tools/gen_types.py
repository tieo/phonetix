"""The authored tables, written out in the form each platform can read.

Everything a component needs to know that is not code - the design tokens, the language names -
is authored once and generated into the shapes the two platforms consume, so a colour or a name
cannot exist on one side and not the other.

The surface page is where every colour, size, radius and spacing is declared, because it is
the thing a person looks at when deciding them. The phone cannot read a stylesheet, so the
same declarations are written out as data and as a Kotlin object, and a check says when the
three have drifted apart. Editing the page and forgetting the phone is then a failing build
rather than a card that looks wrong on one platform only.
