// Link each term of a symbol's description to the article on that term.
//
// A description is a stack of independent phonetic facts: "r-colored open-mid
// central vowel" is r-colouring, and a height, and a backness, and a vowel. Linking
// the phrase as a whole sends the reader to one of them and hides the rest, so each
// term gets its own link.
//
// The article for a term is resolved against Wikipedia, not written from memory. A
// term is disambiguated by the company it keeps: one that only ever appears on
// consonants is looked up as a consonant ("alveolar consonant"), one that only
// appears on vowels as a vowel ("open-mid vowel"). Only titles Wikipedia confirms
// are kept.
