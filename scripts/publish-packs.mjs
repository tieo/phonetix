// Publish the meaning packs to the release the app fetches them from.
//
// A pack is built once out of a dump of gigabytes (see core/packbuild) and does not change
// again, so it belongs in a release rather than on a host somebody has to keep running: the
// pronunciations the app carries are already fetched from one of these at build time. The app
// asks the release for packs.json and then for <lang>.pack, which is what this uploads.
//
//   node scripts/publish-packs.mjs <dir with the built .pack files>
//
// Every file in that directory named <lang>.pack is published, and packs.json is written from
// what is there: the language, how many words it holds, how big it is, and its checksum.
