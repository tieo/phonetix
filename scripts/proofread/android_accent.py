"""The accent the reader chose, on the words and on the card.

An accent is two things: a pack of words a dictionary tagged for one region, and a rule that
holds across a whole vocabulary. Which of them answers a word is the cascade's decision, made
once, so that everything drawn from it agrees. That is the part worth checking on a device:
the overlay and the card ask for the same word by different routes, and for a while the card
asked without the accent at all, so a reader who chose Rioplatense saw it on the page and
lost it the moment they tapped.
