"""The accent the reader chose, on the card the side button shows.

An accent is two things: a pack of words a dictionary tagged for one region, and a rule that
holds across a whole vocabulary. Which of them answers a word is the cascade's decision, made
once, so that everything drawn from it agrees. On the phone a word is answered by the card the
side button shows while it is held over the word, and that card asks the cascade for itself:
for a while it asked without the accent at all, so a reader who chose Rioplatense never saw it.

So the card is read twice for the same word, once with no accent chosen and once in the
accent, and the two have to differ the way the accent says.
