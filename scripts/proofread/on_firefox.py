"""The extension, in the other engine.

Everything else here drives Chrome, and the two engines differ in the one place that decides
whether anything works at all: on Gecko the `chrome` namespace is the callback-style one, so a
call awaited through it returns nothing and the surface that made it quietly concludes there is
nothing there. That is not a thing a Chrome check can fail on, and CI is where it used to be
caught until CI stopped running.

So this launches a real Firefox, headless, on a profile of its own, installs the built add-on
as a temporary one and asks the same questions the Chrome checks ask: is a page annotated, does
the card open on a word, and does the settings view know which site it is looking at.

  uv run python scripts/proofread/on_firefox.py

Nothing of the reader's own Firefox is touched: the profile is made in a temporary directory
and thrown away, and the add-on is temporary, which is why signing does not come into it.
