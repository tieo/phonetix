"""A dictionary rebuilt and published again reaches a phone that already holds the old one.

The phone kept a downloaded pack for good, so the packs rebuilt with narrow transcriptions in
them would have reached nobody who had one already. This puts the first of two Spanish packs on
the phone, publishes the second at a host the phone is pointed at, starts the app again the
way a phone does after an update or a reboot, and checks that the pack the phone holds is now
the second, byte for byte.
