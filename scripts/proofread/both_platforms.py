"""The same word, through the browser's core and the phone's, compared.

The whole arrangement rests on one claim: what a word means is decided in one place, compiled
twice, so a reader on a phone and a reader in a browser cannot be told different things. That
claim is not proved by either side working. It is proved by both being asked the same question
about the same bytes and giving the same answer, which is what this does.

It builds two packs from lines of the dump, runs them through the WebAssembly build under
node and through the native library on a device, and compares the answers character for
character.
