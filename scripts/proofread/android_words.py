"""Is each transcription sitting on the word it is a transcription of?

Every other check here asks whether a transcription is level with a line of text. That cannot
tell one sitting on its own word from one left behind on somebody else's, because both are
level with a line - and a pronunciation of the wrong word is worse than none at all, since a
reader has no way to know it is being told about a word that is not there.

So the pages under test say where each of their lines is and what it says, as it moves, and
every transcription the service reports is matched to the line that was under it at that
moment. Its word has to be on that line or on one touching it: half a line behind is late,
which is a different fault, and only being somewhere else entirely is what this is about.

Readings the moving layer was not drawing do not count. It takes the words off the screen when
it knows it cannot follow the app, and a word withheld is not a word on the wrong text.
