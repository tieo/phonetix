"""The phone telling a reader what a word means and how it is said, through the side button.

This serves the fixture packs the way the release host would, tells the app where they are and
which language the reader reads into, holds the side button on a word and reads the card it
shows while held: the translation with the translation switch on, the pronunciation with the
pronunciation switch on, both with both. The card has to be gone once the button is let go.
