"""The phone showing what a word means, which is what the merge was for.

The app read a screen and drew pronunciations over it. The whole point of putting the two
products together was that it should draw what a word means, in the reader's own language,
with the pronunciation beside it. That is only true if a real dictionary reaches a real
screen, so this serves the fixture packs the way the release host would, tells the app where
they are and which language the reader reads into, and looks at what ends up over the words.
