"""The whole screen in the reader's own language, on a press of the mark.

A word at a time answers "what is that". A page in a language somebody is still learning is a
different question, and a reader who has to ask it word by word has stopped reading. Taplex
answered it by laying the page's own lines over it, translated, on a press of the mark, and
taking them away on the next press; the merge dropped it.

So this presses the mark on a Spanish page and asks three things: that the page comes back in
the reader's language where its own lines were, that our transcriptions are not painted on top
of the replacement, and that a second press gives the page back.
