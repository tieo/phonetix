"""A dictionary too big for a metered connection, fetched once the phone is on one that is not.

What a page needs is fetched by itself, up to a size that depends on what the connection costs:
64 MB on a metered one, more on one that is not. English is about a hundred, so a reader on
mobile data reading an English page is answered without it - and used to stay without it until
they read some other language and came back, because nothing else asked again.

This starts on cellular alone with nothing held, reads an English page into German, checks the
English dictionary is left alone, then turns Wi-Fi on and waits for it to arrive by itself.
It downloads the published English dictionary, a hundred megabytes, every run.
