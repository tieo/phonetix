"""How much of a real app's movement the layer actually followed.

The failure is rare per run and total when it happens, so counting bad runs needs dozens of
them. What the fix changes is continuous and can be measured every fling: the settings app
reports how far it really scrolled, in pixels, and the layer reports how far it carried the
words. The ratio between them is what a reader sees.
