"""The phone's card at the detail the reader asked for.

The app's screen offers broad and narrow transcriptions, and nothing on the phone read the
setting: a card said /ˈtɛpɪç/ whichever was chosen, though the dictionary gives German
"Teppich" a narrow transcription as well, [ˈtʰɛ.pʰɪç]. This holds the side button on that word
with each setting in turn and reads the card while it is held.

The dictionary is built here from the German fixture, which carries the word as Wiktionary
writes it, both transcriptions and their delimiters.
