"""A phone with nothing configured, reading a language it was never told about.

Every language the product knows how to pronounce travels with it, as the gzipped map it has
always shipped as, and a language becomes a pack the first time a screen is read in it. Before
that, the app carried one pack - English, built at compile time - and a reader of anything else
met a screen it could not answer and a dictionary host to go and find.

Nothing is configured here and nothing is served: no host, no language to read into, no
dictionary pushed to the device. What the screen gets is what the app carries.
