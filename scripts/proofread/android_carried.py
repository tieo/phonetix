"""A phone with nothing configured, reading a language it was never told about.

Every language the product knows how to pronounce travels with it, as the gzipped map it has
always shipped as, and a language becomes a pack the first time a screen is read in it. Before
that, the app carried one pack - English, built at compile time - and a reader of anything else
met a screen it could not answer and a dictionary host to go and find.

Nothing is configured here and nothing is served: no host, no language to read into, no
dictionary pushed to the device, and no network at all. A phone with nothing configured fetches
a page's dictionary from the published release by itself, and a fetched dictionary answering
the card would say nothing about what the app carries. The side button is held over Spanish words and the card it
shows has to say how each is said, out of what the app carries.
