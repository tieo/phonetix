"""The panel answers with the word, and answers it at once.

The panel over the page used to put every question to the machine on the phone - somebody
else's app, in another process, which fetches a model of tens of megabytes the first time a
pair is asked for. A reader watching "…" has no way of telling that from a panel that is
broken, and it is the wrong engine anyway: the one this app already holds the models for is
in this process and answers in milliseconds.
