"""Is a transcription on its word, in an app nobody wrote for this test?

Every other check here uses a page that reports where its own lines are, which means the
overlay and the judge are reading the same app, in the same process, with the page's
cooperation. A reader's apps do not cooperate, and the fault they see does not appear in a
fixture: photographed on the settings app, the transcription of "apps" was left standing over
"Notification history, conversations" after "apps" had scrolled away.

So the ground truth here comes from somewhere the overlay has nothing to do with: uiautomator
dumps the accessibility tree itself, independently, and says what text is on the screen and
where. What the service says it drew is read from its own log. A transcription is right when
the word it names is where it was drawn, and wrong when that word is somewhere else or is not
on the screen at all.
