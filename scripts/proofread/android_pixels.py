"""Is the transcription over its own word? Asked of the screen, not of the log.

Every other check here reads what the service says it did. That is what the service believes,
so when the belief is wrong the check agrees with the mistake: measured all day, suites
reported nothing wrong while a photograph of the same moment showed two transcriptions sitting
on the wrong paragraph, and reported thousands of transcriptions judged on a screen that was
carrying none.

This asks the screen. The page paints each line's number into its own background, and the
overlay paints, on each word it draws, the number of the line it believes that word came from.
A photograph then holds both, and the check is a comparison of two colours: the one under the
word and the one on it. Nothing is read from the log, no text is recognised, and a wrong
belief cannot hide, because the page's colour does not come from the overlay.
