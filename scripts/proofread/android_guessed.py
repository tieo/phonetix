"""Where the words are on a page that will not say where its characters are.

An app answers `refreshWithExtraData` with the rectangle of every character of a line, or it
refuses. The reader's own chat app refuses, and a line nobody will place has no words: the
mark passes over a screenful of text with nothing to answer about, which is what "the lens
does not work" looks like from the outside.

So the layout is guessed from the shape of the block and the number of characters in it. A
guess is only worth having if it lands on the word the reader is pointing at, and that cannot
be judged from a screenshot - both fixtures here hold the same words in the same place, and
one of them answers the request:

  mute    the page refusing, so every box on it is a guess
  spoken  the same page answering, so every box on it is the truth

The service is force-stopped between them, because a layout it measured once is remembered and
would be handed back instead of guessed.

  PHONETIX_ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 uv run python scripts/proofread/android_guessed.py

Measured on the build this was written for: 149 of 160 words within half a word of where they
really are, median 34px sideways and 5px down. Before it, with each block's own box deciding
how tall its rows were, 87 of 160 and 281px sideways - whole paragraphs on their first row.
