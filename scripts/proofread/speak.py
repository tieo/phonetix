"""The translator panel's microphone, said into the way a reader says something, in both engines.

The panel is opened from the keyboard over a page and its microphone pressed. The first press
opens the extension's own page to ask for the microphone, once, and the browser's real prompt is
answered on screen; nothing is asked of the site. What is said then is written into the field,
in the language it was said in, and answered like anything typed.

What is said is people's recordings of sentences (Tatoeba). Chromium plays one as its microphone.
Firefox has no such switch, so it is given a microphone of the check's own: a PulseAudio server
started for the check alone, on a socket under /tmp and never the desktop's, whose one source is
a pipe the recording is written into once Firefox is listening. Whatever either browser plays
goes to that server's silent sink.

The model is the one the product fetches, served from a copy kept in .cache/whisper and fetched
from Hugging Face the first time.
