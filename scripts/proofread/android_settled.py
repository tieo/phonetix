"""Which word a spelling is, where the line it is on says, on a phone.

French "est" is "east" and it is "is"; "court" is "short" and it is "runs". Nothing on the page
decides which, and the core asks the host for the line translated: the engine reads the whole
line, and each reading's meaning is looked for in what it wrote. The phone used to answer that
request by translating the word on its own, which drew "est" as whatever a machine made of one
bare word and marked it a guess.

This reads the published French dictionary and Firefox's own French model on the emulator,
over two lines that ask the same two words the two different ways.
