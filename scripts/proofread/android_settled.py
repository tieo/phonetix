"""Which word a spelling is, where the line it is on says, on a phone.

French "est" is "east" and it is "is"; "court" is "short" and it is "runs". Nothing on the page
decides which, and the core asks the host for the line translated: the engine reads the whole
line, and each reading's meaning is looked for in what it wrote. The phone used to answer that
request by translating the word on its own, which drew "est" as whatever a machine made of one
bare word and marked it a guess. The card the side button shows asks the same: it comes up with
what the word says alone and is drawn again once its line has been translated.

This reads the published French dictionary and Firefox's own French model on the emulator,
over two lines that ask the same two words the two different ways, and the published Spanish
dictionary over a line about a park bench, where "banco" has to be the bench and not the bank
its dictionary lists first.
