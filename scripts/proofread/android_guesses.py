"""The phone translating a word no dictionary holds, and saying a machine did it.

The browser has had this since the engine went in; the phone had nothing, so a word with no
entry got no meaning at all there - on a product whose point is telling a reader what a word
means. This is the same engine built native, and what this asks is the same question the
browser's check asks, of the card the side button shows while it is held over the word: that
the word comes back translated. The card marks a machine's meaning by setting it in muted
italics, which its report of what it laid out does not carry, so that half of the browser's
question is left to the eye.

The model is served the way the reader's own host would serve it, and fetched once into
PHONETIX_MODELS.
