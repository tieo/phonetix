"""The phone translating a word no dictionary holds, and saying a machine did it.

The browser has had this since the engine went in; the phone had nothing, so a word with no
entry got no meaning at all there - on a product whose point is telling a reader what a word
means. This is the same engine built native, and what this asks is the same question the
browser's check asks: that the word comes back translated, and comes back marked.

The model is served the way the reader's own host would serve it, and fetched once into
PHONETIX_MODELS.
