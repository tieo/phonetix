"""What the app believes, taken off the device and printed.

A bug in what the overlay draws is a bug in what it believes, and none of that can be seen
from outside: an overlay window is invisible to anything reading the screen, so a screenshot
shows a card without saying which word it is about, and a log line carries one pass's worth of
one decision. This asks the service for the whole of it - the settings in force, the screen it
thinks it is on, every word it believes is there and where, which one the mark is over, and
what the card that is up is actually about - and pulls the file off the device.

Asked for at the moment the thing is going wrong: hold the mark over a word, leave it there,
and run this from the machine.

It grows: when a dump turns out to be missing what an investigation needed, the field goes
into StateDump rather than into a one-off log line.
