"""Talking to a device, and reading what the overlay says it did.

Shared by the overlay test suites. Two things come off the device and they are deliberately
independent of each other:

  * what the service reports it drew, and where (its own account of itself);
  * what the screen actually shows, captured through the emulator console, which is the
    only capture that contains another app's overlay windows.

A test that only ever consults the first is trusting the thing under test. The pixel checks
exist so at least one oracle owes nothing to our own bookkeeping.
