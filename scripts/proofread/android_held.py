"""The lens held still over a word, on a screen that keeps being written into.

Every other check here drags the lens and lets go, because neither `input swipe` nor `input
motionevent` can hold a finger down: the first always lifts at the end of its path and the
second does not keep one gesture open. So the case a reader is actually in - holding the mark
over a word while they read the card - was never driven, and what happens there is this:

A word that reflows by a pixel arrives as a new box. Treated as a different word, it built the
card again - the window torn down and another put up, with a tick under the thumb for each.
Held on a screen whose text keeps moving, that is a card that flickers and a phone that buzzes
without stopping. Measured on an emulator before the fix: six cards built and five torn down in
eight seconds while the finger did not move.

What this asks is narrow and definite: the same word must never be built twice in a row. A
different word arriving under a still lens is the page moving under it, which is the card
doing its job.

Root is needed to write to the touchscreen, and asking for it restarts adbd - which on this
machine took three emulators down within a minute each, and a relaunched one crash-looped and
wrote a gigabyte core per death. So `adb root` is left to whoever runs this, deliberately, and
this is its own script rather than part of android_lens.py: it must not be able to kill an
ordinary run.

What is honest about it: the six-built-five-torn-down measurement above was taken once, on one
emulator, against the build before the fix. Neither fixture here has reproduced it since - the
held word's box has to actually move, and `live` only grows one line while `chat` was never
driven to the end. So this drives the gesture that nothing else here can drive, and it has
never yet failed on the code it was written for. Treat a pass as "the gesture ran", not as
"the flicker cannot come back", until a fixture is found that fails without the fix.
