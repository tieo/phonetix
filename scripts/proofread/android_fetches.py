"""What a page needs arrives by itself.

A reader who opens a page in Spanish, having chosen to read into English, has said everything
the product needs to know: the dictionary of what Spanish words mean, and the model that
translates Spanish into English. Both used to wait behind a list three screens deep with a
button per dictionary, and until the reader found it the page was answered with nothing.

This serves a host the way the published one is laid out - a listing of packs, a listing of
models naming each file with its checksum - starts from a phone holding neither, and asks that
reading a Spanish page is enough for both to arrive and be used.
