"""How far the words are from where they belong, in pixels, frame by frame.

Every other measure here answers yes or no about each transcription and then reports a share,
and a share of a few thousand judgements has been noisy enough that the same build reads 10%
one run and 30% the next. This asks the continuous question instead, which needs no judging at
all: the fixture reports its own scroll position as it changes, every frame the layer draws
names the reading it was drawn from, and the distance between where that reading put the words
and where the page has since got to is the error a reader is looking at.
