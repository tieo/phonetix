"""The word for something a reader wants to say, on the phone.

The other direction, and Taplex's. Everything else the phone does answers a word somebody else
wrote; this answers a word the reader is looking for, and answers it with the same card, so a
machine's answer is judged rather than taken: how it is said, what it means back, what sounds
are in it.

The engine holds the reverse pair open beside the reading direction, so the app opens it, asks,
and leaves the reading direction as it was. That is what this drives, from the panel a tap on
the side button opens, the way a reader reaches it. What the panel shows under the word - how
it is said, what it means back - is drawn in a window nothing reading the screen can see, so
what is asked of it is the word it answered with, which the service reports.
