"""A card too tall for the room beside its word still goes beside it, never over it.

The side button's card sits under the word it is about, or over it, or beside it, wherever it
is clear of the word, the circle on it and the finger. Where there was room on no side it used
to be pushed back onto the screen whole - over the very word it was about, and over the circle
pointing at it, so the reader saw the answer and lost the question.

Asked where it is hardest: the system font at more than twice its size makes the card as tall
as a reader can make it, and the word asked about is the one nearest the middle of the screen,
where each side has half of it. The side button is held over that word, and every place the
card is put while it is up has to leave the word in sight and stay on the screen. The card is
compact now, about a fifth of the screen even at this size, so this is a guard that the
placement keeps its rule rather than a case that is tight today.
