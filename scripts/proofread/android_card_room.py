"""A card too tall for the room beside its word goes beside it anyway, and scrolls.

A card sits under the word it is about, or over it where there is no room under. Where there
was room on neither side it was pushed back onto the screen whole - over the very word it was
about, and over the circle pointing at it. It is now cut to the larger side and scrolls.

Made to happen on purpose: the system font at more than twice its size makes any card tall, and the word
asked about is the one nearest the middle of the screen, where each side has half of it.
