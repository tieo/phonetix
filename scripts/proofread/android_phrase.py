"""Asking about several words at once, on a phone.

The browser has this: a reader drags across a clause and the card answers the clause, marked
as a machine's guess. The phone had nothing, because a reader cannot select an app's own text -
the words belong to the app and our overlay takes no touches at all.

So the run is swept with the mark: held down first, then dragged, and every word the circle
passes over joins it. This drives that gesture with real motion events, because the hold has
to come before the movement and `input swipe` starts moving at once.
