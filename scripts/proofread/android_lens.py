"""The lens: the way to ask about a word without taking the screen's touches.

A transcription lying over a word can only be tapped if the overlay takes touches, and an
overlay that takes touches takes the swipe that started on a word with it. On a page of text
that is most of the page, which is why the transcriptions are untouchable by default - and
why, without the lens, there is no way at all to ask what a word means.

So this drags the lens across a page and checks that it says what it passes over, that a card
opens for that word, and that the page underneath still scrolls while it does.
