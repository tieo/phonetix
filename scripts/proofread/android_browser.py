"""How much of a web page carries a transcription.

A browser hands its page over only while it is being touched and takes it back when it is
left alone, so the one moment its words can be measured is the moment it is moving - which is
the moment the read used to refuse to measure anything. This loads an article, flings it, and
counts the words drawn while it moves and after it stops, against the words uiautomator says
are on the screen.
