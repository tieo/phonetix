"""What the mark knows while an answer is being written into the page.

A conversation that is being written into changes the lines under the overlay's plan several
times a second. A following pass then carries only the lines that happened not to change, and
that was counted a success as long as it carried one: the overlay was left believing in a
single word on a screenful of them, and the mark dragged across the page answered "nothing"
from one end to the other.

Taken off a reader's own phone while an answer was being written: one word believed, where a
full read of the same screen found forty-seven.

What this asks is that the overlay keeps believing in most of the page while the page is being
written into - not that it is perfect, which it cannot be on a screen whose text is changing,
but that it does not collapse to a handful.
