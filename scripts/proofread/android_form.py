"""The phone's card for a word that is a form of another, read from the real Spanish dictionary.

A card over "corre" used to lead with "to run", the meaning of "correr", over a word that means
"he runs". It now says the meaning in the form the word has, names the form in grammar's own
terms and which word it is a form of ("present · indicative · 3rd singular of correr"), and
sets the word's own ending apart, with no stress marks while they are off. This holds the side button on such words of the Spanish page
and reads the card while it is held.

The dictionary is the real one, as the release publishes it: fixture packs are written for the
words a check asks about and hid every mistake real tables make. PHONETIX_ES_PACK names it
(default .cache/release/es.pack, which tools/build_packs.sh writes).
