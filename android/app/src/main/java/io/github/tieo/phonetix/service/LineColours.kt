/**
 * The colours each line of text is drawn in, read off the screen and kept per app.
 *
 * Accessibility carries no colour, so the only way a transcription can wear the ink and
 * surface of the text it replaces is to capture the display and sample the line - and only
 * ever from a frame taken while our own transcriptions are hidden, or the sampler reads its
 * own paint back as the app's.
 *
 * A line is the unit, not a word. One word carries a few dozen glyph pixels and a short one
 * carries none worth the name; a line carries thousands, and every word on it is drawn in
 * the colour of its neighbours. Keying on the line's own text also keeps a heading apart
 * from the paragraph under it, and one message in a conversation apart from the next, which
 * a single colour per app cannot do.
