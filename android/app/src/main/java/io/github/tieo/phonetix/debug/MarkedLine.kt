 * A line of the test page that says where it is in the picture, not only in the log.
 *
 * It paints a short bar at its left edge, inside the page's padding, where no transcription
 * can be - the page's words start well right of it. A capture of the real screen then holds
 * both this and the bar every transcription wears, so a test can ask whether a transcription
 * is on a line of text without believing a word the service says about itself.
