 * synthesiser behind that for the rest, which is why a word it has never seen still comes back
 * with a transcription there; the phone had none, so those words came back bare and the audio
 * was whatever voice the system happened to carry.
 *
 * The engine reads its data from a directory rather than from the apk, so the data is unpacked
 * once on first use and kept. It is a megabyte and a half of tables plus one small file per
 * language, so this is not a download and not a decision a reader has to make.
