 * What the reader needs, fetched without asking them to.

 * A reader who picks a language, opens a page, or asks the panel for a word has said what
 * they need; making them then find a list and press a button per dictionary was a step
 * nobody could work out, and until they found it the product answered nothing. So each of
 * those moments asks for what it needs here, and it arrives in the background.
 *
 * On a thread of its own. A model is tens of megabytes, and the thread that reads the screen
 * waiting on a download is a screen that stops being read. Each thing is fetched once at a
 * time however often it is asked for, and one that failed is left alone for a while rather
 * than asked for again on every screen - a host that is down is otherwise a download started
 * on every pass.
