 * drawn here. Which rows a surface shows is the view's own decision, from what it is told it
 * is drawn on - a browser has sites and a pointer, a phone has apps, permissions and a mark -
 * and everything else is one screen written once. A second implementation in Compose is how
 * the two halves of one product drifted into two products with different words for the same

 *
 * What the web view cannot do for itself is here: reading and writing the settings, the
