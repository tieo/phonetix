 * The translation engine, and the models it reads.

 * entry, a pair no pack covers. What it produces is a guess and is marked as one all the way to
 * the card, because a machine's answer wearing a dictionary's authority is what the whole
 * cascade is shaped to avoid.
 *
 * The same engine the browser runs, built native. Where the models come from is the reader's
 * own host, the same one the packs come from: nothing here reaches for a stranger's server on
 * their behalf, and with no host set there is no translation rather than a request.
