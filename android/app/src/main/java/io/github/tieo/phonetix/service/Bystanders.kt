 * The apps a transcription has no business being on.
 *
 * The home screen is a grid of names, the status bar and the notification shade are
 * controls, and a keyboard is the thing being typed on: none of them is text anyone reads for
 * its pronunciation, and covering their words costs a read of the tree every time they move.
 * The reader turning the overlay on for "every app" means every app they read in, and these
 * are not that.
 *
 * Which packages those are differs by device, so they are looked up rather than listed: the
 * launcher is whatever answers the home intent, the keyboards are whatever input methods are
 * enabled. Looked up rarely, because they change about never.
