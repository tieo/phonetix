/**
 * Whether the screen in front of the reader is in the language the dictionary is for.
 *
 * There is one dictionary here, English, and until now every word on the screen was looked up
 * in it. That put English pronunciations through German sentences: a reader in Germany got them
 * on "Song" and "Video", and on "war", "hat" and "man", which are German words that happen to
 * be spelled like English ones.
 *
 * The question is asked of the screen, not of each line. [Eld] is a good judge of a paragraph
 * and a poor one of a handful of words: asked about "zebra anchor basket copper diamond engine
 * falcon granite" it answers Italian, and says it is sure. Those are English nouns. A line of a
 * page carries no function words to speak of, which is what a detector reads a language from,
 * and suppressing lines one at a time on that evidence left an English page with most of its
 * words untranscribed - a far worse fault than transcribing a German one.
 *
 * All the text on the screen together does carry them, and that is the same thing the extension
 * leans on when a block is too short to judge: the language of the page it is on.
