/**
 * What the transcriptions ride on while the screen is moving.
 *
 * Standing still, each word has its own small window: that is what makes one tappable and
 * what lets every other touch through. Moving, that is the wrong shape entirely - carrying
 * a dozen windows would be a dozen calls to the window manager on every frame - so the
 * whole set is drawn on one full-screen layer instead, which moves by shifting a canvas.
 *
 * Between measurements it predicts. A scroll is only sampled as often as the lines can be
 * asked where they are, tens of milliseconds apart, and stepping the words from one sample
 * to the next looks exactly as stuttery as it is. So the layer carries them at the speed
 * the last samples showed, and each new measurement corrects the position and the speed it
 * is running at. When the speed falls away the motion is over and the small windows come
 * back.
