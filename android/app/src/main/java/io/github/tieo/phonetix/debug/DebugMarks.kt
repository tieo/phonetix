/**
 * Marks that make the overlay and the page findable in a photograph of the screen.
 *
 * Every other test here reads what the service says it did. That is the wrong witness for the
 * one question that matters - whether a reader looking at the screen sees a transcription on
 * its word - because a service can report a position it never drew, draw it a frame late, or
 * draw it and have the window land somewhere else. So a test can ask for these instead: each
 * transcription paints a short bar in one colour and each line of the test page paints one in
 * another, and a capture of the real screen then says where both of them actually are, with
 * nothing of ours in between.
 *
 * Off unless a test switches it on, so the build a reader is holding looks as it should.
