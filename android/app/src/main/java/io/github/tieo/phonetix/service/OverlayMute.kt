 * The service hears the events of every app, its own included, and everything it draws is a
 * window: a transcription appearing counted as the screen changing, which asked for another
 * reading, which drew again. The overlay was reading the screen over and over because it
 * could see itself, and never got as far as a full read - so the words kept the colours they
 * had never been given.
