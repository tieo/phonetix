 * here was a compressed map of word to transcription that this platform parsed itself, which
 * meant a pronunciation had two paths and one of them could be wrong on its own.
 *
 * The pack ships in the app's assets and is copied out once, because a pack is read where it
 * lies and an asset inside an APK is not a file.
