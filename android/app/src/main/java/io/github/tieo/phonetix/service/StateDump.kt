/**
 * Everything the service believes, written out where it can be read from outside the app.
 *
 * A bug in what the overlay draws is a bug in what it believes: which words it thinks are on
 * the screen, where it thinks they are, which one it thinks the mark is over, and what the
 * card that is up is actually about. None of that is visible from a screenshot - an overlay
 * window is invisible to a tool reading the screen, and a log line says only what one pass
 * decided. So the whole of it goes into one file, on demand, and is pulled off the device.
 *
 * Asked for with a broadcast, so it works on a phone in a reader's hand at the moment the
 * thing is going wrong:
 *
 *     adb shell am broadcast -a io.github.tieo.phonetix.DUMP -p io.github.tieo.phonetix
 *     scripts/proofread/state.py            (sends it, pulls the file, prints it)
 *
 * It grows: when a dump turns out to be missing what an investigation needed, the field goes
 * in here rather than into a one-off log line.
