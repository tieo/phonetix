/**
 * Saying things out loud: the word itself through the phone's own speech engine, and a
 * single sound through the recording Wikimedia holds for it.
 *
 * The extension speaks a word with espeak and plays Wikimedia's recordings for the symbols.
 * Both are the same here: the recordings are the same files, and the speech is the same
 * engine in the same voice, so a word does not sound like two different products depending on
 * where a reader met it.
 *
 * The phone's own text-to-speech is the fallback and only that. It says a word in whatever
 * voice the reader installed, which is a different voice per phone and says nothing about the
 * accent they chose; and it cannot say a word in a language they have no voice for, which is
 * most of the languages this reads.
