 * The overlay's way into the reading core.

 * The core is one Rust crate compiled twice, once to WebAssembly for the browser extension and
 * once to a native library per Android ABI. Everything about what a word means and how it is
 * said lives there, so neither platform can answer differently from the other, and neither can
 * reach a pack any other way.
 *
 * The boundary is crossed per batch and never per word: reading the accessibility tree and
 * placing boxes stays on this side and runs many times a second, while the core is asked only
 * when the set of text on the screen has changed.
