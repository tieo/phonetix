 * The frequency control and the word choice behind it, kept identical to the browser
 * extension so the same setting means the same thing on both.
 *
 * The bar controls one word in N, and frequency is felt in ratios rather than in N: the
 * step from 1-in-2 to 1-in-4 is a world apart, 1-in-40 to 1-in-42 is nothing. A straight
 * linear N spends most of its travel among sparse densities no one can tell apart, so the
 * curve is bent partway toward geometric — far enough to read as logarithmic, not so far
 * that it feels extreme.
