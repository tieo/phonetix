 * The other half of what this is for. A word at a time answers "what is that": a page of a
 * language somebody is still learning is a different question, and a reader who has to ask it
 * word by word has stopped reading. Carried over from Taplex, where a tap on the mark laid the
 * page's own lines over it translated and the next tap took them away.
 *
 * The lines are drawn where the app drew them, in the colours the app used, so the screen
 * keeps its shape and only reads differently. Nothing here takes a touch: the app underneath
 * is still the thing being scrolled, and the mark is the only way back out.
