/**
 * The small pictures the card uses in place of words.
 *
 * From the icon set rather than drawn here. Cut by hand in a canvas, each of these was a shape
 * this repository had to keep legible at every size and did not: the microphone's head is a
 * capsule, and at the size the mark is drawn its straight sides came to about two pixels, so
 * it read as a lollipop. A set that does nothing else gets that right and keeps getting it
 * right.
 *
 * What is ours is which picture means what, and that a reader is always shown it: a voice a
 * machine made and a voice a person recorded are different things, and the difference is drawn
 * rather than spelled out.

 * Filled with the accent rather than outlined, because it is the one thing on the card that
 * does something to the world, and a reader looking for it should not have to find it.
