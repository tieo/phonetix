/**
 * A screenful of transcriptions on one window, for the words that do not have to be touched.
 *
 * A window per word is what lets one word be held for its card, and it is also a ceiling: a
 * device will not hand an app an unbounded number of windows, so the overlay stopped at
 * ninety-six and a page with more words than that was transcribed down to there and left bare
 * below - ninety-six of a hundred and forty-four on a page somebody was reading. Every read
 * also moved and repainted all of them, a call into the window manager each, which is most of
 * what made a page appear a piece at a time.
 *
 * This has no ceiling and costs one draw. What it cannot do is take a touch on one word:
 * Android has no public way to make a window touchable over part of itself, so a full-screen
 * window either swallows every scroll or takes nothing at all. It takes nothing. Where the
 * reader has asked to hold a word for its card, the words that answer a hold keep windows of
 * their own and this draws whatever is left over, so the page is whole either way.
