/**
 * Reads the text of the app in front and hands the overlay the words to transcribe.
 *
 * Accessibility gives a node's text and the node's own rectangle, which is a whole
 * paragraph and far too coarse to put a transcription on one word. The per-character
 * rectangles asked for below are what make word-level placement possible at all: the
 * characters of a word are unioned into that word's exact box.
 *
 * Two rules govern the timing, and they pull in opposite directions. Putting a
 * transcription up may take a moment. Taking one down may not: the instant the screen
 * moves every transcription is in the wrong place, so they are hidden synchronously from
 * the event itself and only restored once the screen has been read again.
