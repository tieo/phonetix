/**
 * The surfaces the overlay is tested against, and the ground truth for testing it.
 *
 * Every fault this overlay has had came from movement or from what surrounds a word, and
 * neither shows on a still screen. So this puts up a page whose scroll position is known to
 * the pixel at every instant - it reports it as it changes - which is what lets a test say
 * where a transcription should have been at the moment it was drawn, rather than only where
 * it ended up.
 *
 * The modes are the situations that broke it before: a plain page, a page with a bar the
 * text scrolls under, lines in colours the test knows, and a window the system refuses to
 * let anyone capture.
