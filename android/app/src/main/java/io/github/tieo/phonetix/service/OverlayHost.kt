/**
 * What a Compose view needs in order to live in a window a service put up.
 *
 * An activity hands its content a lifecycle, a saved-state registry and a view-model store
 * without being asked. A service has none of those, and Compose refuses to draw without them,
 * so this is the smallest honest set: a lifecycle that is resumed while the window is up and
 * destroyed when it comes down, and stores that are emptied with it.
 *
 * Nothing here is saved across a process restart, and nothing should be: an overlay window is
 * about the word under the reader's finger right now, and there is no such word after a
 * restart.
