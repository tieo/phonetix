/**
 * The circle a reader drags across a screen to be told what a word is.
 *
 * Carried over from Taplex, where this gesture was built, because the ring that replaced it
 * in the merge was under the finger: the word being asked about was under the hand asking.
 * Here the mark stays under the thumb that picked it up and the circle that does the looking
 * rides a clear distance above it, joined by a thread of light, so what is being read is in
 * sight the whole time.
 *
 * Nothing here takes a touch except the mark itself. The screen underneath keeps working
 * while the reader drags over it, which is the whole point: a transcription that can be
 * tapped swallows the swipe that started on it, and on a page of text that is most of the
 * page.
 *
 * The mark rests at the edge when it is let go, so it is somewhere to reach for rather than
 * something in the way, and the thread draws itself back into it.
