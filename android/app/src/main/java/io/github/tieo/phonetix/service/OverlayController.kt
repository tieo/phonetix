/**

 * A window per word rather than one sheet over the screen, for two reasons. It can be
 * touched: a full-screen sheet would either swallow every tap meant for the app beneath or,
 * made untouchable, refuse the taps meant for the transcriptions themselves, while a window
 * that covers only a word takes the taps on that word and leaves the rest of the screen
 * alone. And it covers exactly the word: the window is the word's own rectangle, so nothing
 * of the original shows around the edges.
 *
 * The windows are pooled and moved rather than added and removed, because the words shift
 * on every scroll and window churn is the expensive part.
