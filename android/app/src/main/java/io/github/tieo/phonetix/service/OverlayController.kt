 * bare - and every pass moved and repainted each of them, a call into the window manager
 * apiece. A hundred and thirty of those exhausted the graphics buffers of a device outright.
 *
 * Touches are taken by an invisible window over each line of text, not each word. A line is
 * a dozen words, so a screenful is a dozen windows instead of a hundred, and a touch inside
 * one is matched to the word nearest it - which also means a tap answers a word the bar did
