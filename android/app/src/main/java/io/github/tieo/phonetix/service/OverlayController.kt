 * made untouchable, refuse the taps meant for the transcriptions themselves, while a window
 * that covers only a word takes the taps on that word and leaves the rest of the screen
 * alone. And it covers exactly the word: the window is the word's own rectangle, so nothing
 * of the original shows around the edges.

 * The windows are pooled and moved rather than added and removed, because the words shift
