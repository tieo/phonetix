/**
 * Where a page has been over the last second, and where that says it is now.
 *
 * A scroll is not a constant speed. A finger accelerates, lifts, and the fling that follows
 * decelerates the whole way down to nothing, and every one of those is happening while the
 * layer is being told about the page only every hundred milliseconds. Carrying the words at
 * the speed of the last interval assumes the page is doing now what it was doing then, which
 * through a fling is never true: it is always faster than the news at the start of one and
 * slower at the end.
 *
 * So the news is kept rather than consumed. Each report of where the page has got to is a
 * sample, the samples of the last second are fitted, and what the fit says about this instant
 * is where the words go. Deceleration comes out of the fit rather than being assumed, which is
 * what lets the words stay with the text through the part of a fling where the speed is
 * halving every few frames.
