/**
 * What a word the reader is looking for is answered by, before they have configured anything.

 * The dictionaries and the reading engine are the reader's own: they choose a host, they choose
 * what to keep, and nothing is fetched behind their back. This question comes before all of
 * that - it is asked by somebody who has just installed the app and wants the word for
 * something - so it is answered by the machine on the phone, which fetches what it needs for a
 * pair itself. It is what Taplex answered with, and the reason its panel worked out of the box.
 *
 * It also says which language something was typed in, so a reader can ask in any language they
 * please rather than in the one this app assumed.
