/**
 * The Kotlin detector against the JavaScript one it was ported from.
 *
 * The point of porting eld rather than inventing something was that the app and the extension
 * should agree about what language a line is in. That is only true if the port answers the
 * same questions the same way, and the only way to know is to ask both: the expected answers
 * here were produced by running eld itself over these texts
 * (`node scripts/build-eld-model.mjs` writes the model, and the same script's sibling wrote
 * this list), and this holds the port to them.
