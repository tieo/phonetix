/**
 * The hand-rolled scanner must match the regex it replaced, exactly.
 *
 * It was swapped in for speed - a regex allocates a match object per word, on every piece
 * of text on screen, on every pass - and speed is no reason to change which characters
 * count as a word. This holds the loop to `[\p{L}][\p{L}'’]*` over text chosen to hit the
 * places the two could disagree: apostrophes at both ends, digits against letters, accents,
 * non-Latin scripts, and characters outside the basic plane.
