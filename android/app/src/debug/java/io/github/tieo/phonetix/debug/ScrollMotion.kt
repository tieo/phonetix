/**
 * Scrolls the test page the way hands and platforms actually scroll it.
 *
 * A test that scrolls one way proves the overlay follows that one way. Real movement is
 * never a straight line: a finger accelerates and decelerates, a fling decays, a reader
 * moves the page in short strokes with pauses between them, and every one of those has a
 * different relationship between the moment the overlay reads a position and the moment the
 * page is somewhere else. Each profile below is a shape of movement to hold the overlay
 * against, driven frame by frame so the page reports where it is throughout.
 *
 * The shapes are the ones movement science uses for this. Minimum jerk is the classical
 * model of an unimpeded human reach (Flash and Hogan, 1985): position follows
 * 10t^3 - 15t^4 + 6t^5, smooth at both ends and fastest in the middle. The lognormal is
 * Plamondon's kinematic theory, where the velocity of a rapid stroke is a lognormal in time
 * and position is its integral, which is asymmetric - quick to speed up, long to settle -
 * in the way a real flick is. The rest are the degenerate cases worth keeping honest
 * against: a constant speed nothing biological produces, and pure acceleration.
